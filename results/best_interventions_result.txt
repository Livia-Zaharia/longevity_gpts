3. Changes in gene activity protect against age-related impairment
4. Association of genetic variants and gene expression levels with longevity
5. Age-related changes in gene expression, methylation, or protein activity in humans
6. Age-related changes in gene expression, methylation, or protein activity
7. Changes in gene activity reduce non-mammalian lifespan

Question: What evidence of the link between PTEN and aging do you know?
Result: The evidence linking PTEN (Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog) to aging includes several aspects:

### Gene Criteria
1. **Changes in gene activity extend mammalian lifespan**: PTEN has been associated with mechanisms that can extend lifespan in mammals.
2. **Age-related changes in gene expression, methylation, or protein activity**: PTEN shows age-related changes in its expression and activity, which may influence aging processes.
3. **Regulation of genes associated with aging**: PTEN is involved in the regulation of other genes that are linked to aging.
4. **Changes in gene activity reduce mammalian lifespan**: Alterations in PTEN activity can lead to a reduction in lifespan in mammals.
5. **Changes in gene activity protect against age-related impairment**: PTEN activity is linked to protective mechanisms against age-related decline.
6. **Association of genetic variants and gene expression levels with longevity**: Variants in the PTEN gene have been associated with longevity.

### Hallmarks of Aging
PTEN is linked to the following hallmarks of aging:
- **Senescent cells accumulation**: PTEN may play a role in the accumulation of senescent cells, which is a hallmark of aging.
- **Intercellular communication impairment**: PTEN is involved in processes that affect communication between cells, which can deteriorate with age.

### Longevity Associations
There is a specific association with a polymorphism in the PTEN gene:
- **Polymorphism Type**: SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism)
- **Polymorphism ID**: rs1022427
- **Ethnicity**: Caucasian
- **Study Type**: Candidate genes study
- **Sex**: Female
- **DOI**: [10.1111/j.1474-9726.2009.00493.x](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1474-9726.2009.00493.x)

This evidence collectively supports the role of PTEN in aging and longevity, highlighting its importance in various biological processes related to lifespan regulation.
